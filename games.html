            Tower Forge is a tower defense type game I made in collaboration
            with friend who made the art. In Tower Forge, you play as dwarves
            defending their city against an alien invasion. They way the game
            differs from others tower defense games is that you can build the
            towers the way you want, choosing the combination of base/weapon
            each tower is going to use. It is up to the player to choose what
            element will go well with the others to make sure no alien will get
            through his defenses. This game is available on the itch.io website
            and was developed using Unity.

          <p class="explanation">
            Color Race is an arcade game developed for mobiles where the player
            has to get though colored obstacles. The only way to survive is to
            not hit these, unless the player's color is the same than the
            obstacle. The goal of this game was to me, as a developer, to learn
            about game publishing on a store and how ads integration works.
            Color Race was developed using Unity.
