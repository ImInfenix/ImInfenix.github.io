            . In Tower Forge, you play as dwarves defending their city against
            an alien invasion. They way the game differs from others tower
            defense games is that you can build the towers the way you want,
            choosing the combination of base/weapon each tower is going to use.
            It is up to the player to choose what element will go well with the
            others to make sure no alien will get through his defenses. This
            game is available on the itch.io website and was developed using
            Unity.

          <p class="explanation">
            Color Race is an arcade game developed for mobiles where the player
            has to get though colored obstacles. The only way to survive is to
            not hit these, unless the player's color is the same than the
            obstacle. The goal of this game was to me, as a developer, to learn
            about game publishing on a store and how ads integration works.
            Color Race was developed using Unity, Photoshop, FL Studio and
            Audacity.

          <p class="explanation">
            On January 2020, the ESIR Game Jam (my engineering school) was
            organized. This Game Jam's theme was "Safe In the Dark". With my
            group made of four people including another programmer, we decided
            to make a two local player game where the first player is trying to
            escape from a prison. The second player helps him in achieving this
            goal after becoming "Shadow", an entity able to hide every source of
            light and deactivating it. 2045 was made in 35 hours using Unity,
            Photoshop and Audacity.

            Pop-Up run was my submission at the GDA Jam in 2019 made in a team
            of four people. The theme was "No Signal". I was the only programmer
            on the team as the three other were digital artists students. In
            Pop-Up Run, you have to find your way through the Internet with a
            runner-like gameplay while ads keep coming to cover your UI. You
            have to close enough ads to open the end of the game where you can
            finally be at peace. But be careful ! If you click on ads instead of
            closing theme, more ads will be coming ! The game was made using
            Unity, Photoshop, 3DS Max and Audacity.
